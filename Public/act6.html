    <p> Good day!,I am Hanna Fe Callao Rico></a>
         18 years old,I was born in Bulacan,Manila.My mother is Terife Siton Callao,and my father is Wilmer Dela Cruz Rico.
         My birthday is on<a  href="../Public/act3.html">15th of june</a>
         and I am the eldest of my 5 siblings ,3 from my father's side and 2 on my mother's.They went their own seperate ways and now had thier own family,
         and them breaking up had affected me mentally and emotionally,maybe thats's why I envy those who still have their family complete and happy.
         there were times where I understood why it happened but,I can't help but long for my parents to get along for my sake and bond with them.
         And now as I grew older my mind became open on such situations and I understood how hard it is too for my parents,
         and I respect them from the very bottom of my heart.Now that I'm on my college years,
         I must take this seriously,because my parents relies on me to be able to help them from poverty,
         and I,too, want a better life for us too,especially for my siblings.
     </p>
        
     <p>
         I love sports such as;volleyball,badminton,and swimming.I wasn't able to pursue them because I have responsibilities at home and I lack the time.
         Instead,watching movies became my thing and I enjoy it.And also,I cook delicious meals at home,and Pork Sinigang is my favorite.
         I don't want to get fat at home for always eating,so I do exercises to stay in good shape!
        
    </p>


    <p>When I finally reach my goal to have a better and stable life,I want to travel the world and explore new things with my family.
        I want them to experience a comfortable life,where they won't have to worry about money anymore.
        And for my siblings to get the proper education they need without worrying about their financial needs,
        I want them to have a good life and not experience the hardships I had to go through.
        And I want to build my own business with the help of my parents then after
        that,I want to make my own family,not just a family,but a complete happy family.</p><br>
